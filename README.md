The project uses the [Github API for Java](https://github.com/github-api/github-api). You can use it as soon as you download the project.

## Feautures
The project currently supports the following operations:
- Log in to your GitHub user account
- List all your repositories (Private and Public)
- Delete a repository (Be careful!)

## Future Improvements
- As shown in the [documentation](http://github-api.kohsuke.org/), is a bad idea to authenticate a user with its password directly, so a future version of the project might try with the Personal Access Token.
- To show the file directory of the project.
- Implement the rest of the GitHub functions.

## Inspiration
The app's design is based on GitHub's actual page. Thanks to the guys at [github-api](https://github.com/github-api) for their well documented API.
